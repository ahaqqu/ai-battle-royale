# provision/vps — deploy GUNBATTE ROYALE to the VPS

Target topology (cohabiting with the existing apps — add-only, nothing shared
is ever edited):

```
internet ──▶ nginx :80/:443 (shared; kajianq.conf + gunbatte.conf by Host header)
                ├── play.<domain>  ──proxy──▶ 127.0.0.1:8321  gunbatte-server (gunbatte.service)
                └── site.<domain>  ──static── $GUNBATTE_DIR/website/
```

State lives in `$GUNBATTE_DIR` (default `~/gunbatte`): the binary, `viewer/dist/`,
`website/`, and the server's own data (`ladder.db`, `replays/`).

## One-time bootstrap

DNS first: point `play.<domain>` and `site.<domain>` (A records) at the VPS.
Then, from the repo root:

```sh
GUNBATTE_GAME_HOST=play.example.com \
GUNBATTE_SITE_HOST=gunbatte.example.com \
GUNBATTE_EMAIL=you@example.com \
./provision/vps/deploy.sh --bootstrap
```

This builds the viewer + server locally (no Rust toolchain needed on the VPS),
uploads everything, then runs `apply.sh` on the VPS over ssh — it will prompt
for the sudo password once. `apply.sh`:

1. installs `gunbatte.service` (systemd, dedicated user, binds `127.0.0.1`)
2. installs a sudoers drop-in: passwordless `systemctl restart/status
   gunbatte.service` for the deploy user **only**
3. installs the nginx site file (add-only; `nginx -t` before reload)
4. issues Let's Encrypt certificates via `certbot --nginx` (skipped with a
   warning until both hostnames resolve to the VPS — just re-run)
5. starts the service

## Updates

```sh
GUNBATTE_GAME_HOST=play.gunbatte.ahaqqu.com ./provision/vps/deploy.sh
```

No sudo, no prompts: the sudoers drop-in covers the restart. The server's
state (`ladder.db`, `replays/`) is never touched by uploads.

## Automatic deploys (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` fires **after CI finishes green on main** and
runs the same `deploy.sh` — one deploy path for CI and humans. **All values
live as repository variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
`VPS_USER`, `VPS_HOST`, `GUNBATTE_GAME_HOST`, `GUNBATTE_SITE_HOST`,
`GUNBATTE_PORT`, `GUNBATTE_EMAIL`. deploy.sh reads the same variables via
`gh`, so there is exactly one source of configuration. CI never holds an
admin identity — the admin account appears only when **you** run the
one-time bootstrap, named by the `GUNBATTE_ADMIN_SSH` env var. One-time key
setup:

```sh
# 1. a dedicated, revocable keypair for the deploy identity (no passphrase):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/gunbatte-deploy -N "" -C "gunbatte-vps-deploy-key"

# 2. pin the host key:
ssh-keyscan 62.83.35.220 > /tmp/vps_known_hosts
```

Then add two GitHub **repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `VPS_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | contents of `~/.ssh/gunbatte-deploy` (the private key) |
| `VPS_KNOWN_HOSTS` | contents of `/tmp/vps_known_hosts` |

The **public** half is installed into the deploy identity's
`authorized_keys` by `--bootstrap` itself (idempotent append — kajianq's own
key line is kept). After that, every merge to main that passes CI deploys
itself. To revoke CI's access, delete its line from the deploy identity's
`authorized_keys` on the VPS. Until the first `--bootstrap` has run, the
workflow only uploads artifacts and prints a reminder — the final restart
needs the service to exist.

## Files

| File | Runs on | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `deploy.sh` | local | build + upload + (bootstrap or restart) + post-deploy doctor gate |
| `apply.sh` | VPS | install unit / sudoers / nginx / certs, reconcile limits, start service |
| `gunbatte.service` | — | systemd unit template (`__GUNBATTE_*__` placeholders) |
| `nginx/gunbatte.conf` | — | nginx site template (HTTP-only; certbot adds TLS in place) |
| `nginx/reconcile-limits.sh` | VPS | add-only reconcile of the #37 abuse limits into an installed site file (`--dry-run` previews) |

## Abuse limits (issue #37)

Availability and ladder-integrity ceilings, split by who can see the real
client IP: nginx limits per IP, the app limits totals (behind the proxy the
app's socket address is 127.0.0.1, so per-IP state there would be useless).

| Layer | Limit | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| nginx `limit_conn` | 10 per IP on `/ws/bot` + `/ws/spectate` | per-IP socket ceiling |
| nginx `limit_req` | 10 WS handshakes/min per IP, burst 20 | reconnect churn, room-code brute-forcing |
| nginx `client_max_body_size` | 1m | inputs are ~200 bytes; nothing takes uploads |
| app `--max-connections` | 256 | concurrent sockets (bots + spectators share one pool); full pool refuses the upgrade |
| app `--max-lobbies` | 64 | live private rooms |
| app `--join-attempts-per-min` | 30 | global failed-`join` bucket (~1M code space stays impractical to brute-force) |
| app `--new-names-per-min` | 60 | global first-time-registration bucket (name cycling cannot spam `bots` rows; reconnects bypass it) |
| app `--max-replays` | 100 | startup sweep deletes the oldest `match-*.json` (hand-placed fixtures are never touched) |
| app HTTP layers | 30s request timeout on dynamic routes, 256 global in-flight | slowloris / run-away request insurance; replay downloads are exempt from the timeout |

`0` on any app knob disables that ceiling. The request timeout is applied only
to dynamic routes — a tens-of-MB replay download over a slow link is
legitimate — while the in-flight cap covers everything, replays included.

**Applying the nginx half:** every deploy ships the updated template files,
but only `apply.sh` may touch nginx — and it never re-installs an installed
site file, because certbot owns its TLS edits. To land a template change on
the VPS, re-run `apply.sh` (as root, as in the bootstrap); its limits
reconcile (`nginx/reconcile-limits.sh`) is add-only — it inserts the zones,
the `/ws/*` location blocks, and the 1m body cap if missing, never touching
hostnames, TLS, or redirects — and is a verified no-op when everything is
already in place. Preview first with
`sudo bash $GUNBATTE_DIR/provision/vps/nginx/reconcile-limits.sh --dry-run`
(the `--dry-run` flag is deliberate: `sudo` strips environment variables, so
a `DRY_RUN=1` prefix would silently not survive it).
Normal deploys deliberately cannot do this step: the deploy identity's sudo
grant is scoped to the app service, so CI can never edit nginx.

**The post-deploy gate:** every non-bootstrap deploy ends with the shared-box
doctor sweep — nginx config test, `sites-enabled/` hygiene, failed units,
every app's listeners and certs. A gunbatte deploy that leaves the box
unhealthy turns its own run red, with no cross-repo review needed. The sweep
is **vendored** at `provision/vps/doctor.sh` (canonical copy: the private
ahaqqu/homepage repo, `provision/vps/` — the box cannot fetch from a private
repo unauthenticated and the gate must not need a credential) and piped over
ssh stdin: nothing is fetched at deploy time and nothing lands on the box's
disk. It runs as the deploy identity, whose sudoers drop-in carries two
read-only diagnostics for it (`nginx -t`, `certbot certificates` — neither
changes state); re-run `apply.sh` once after merging to install that widened
grant. Until then the sweep degrades to warnings. The box-wide view of what
doctor checks lives in homepage's private `MACHINE.md`.

When one of these fires in production, [LIMITS.md](../../LIMITS.md) maps the
symptom the client sees to the knob that caused it.

## Why this can't disturb the other apps

- One new nginx file, symlinked into `sites-enabled/`; existing server blocks
  are never edited, and `nginx -t` gates every reload (reload is graceful).
- Own systemd unit on its own loopback port; restarts affect only this app.
- Separate Let's Encrypt lineage; certbot edits only the gunbatte site file.
- The `--bind 127.0.0.1` flag keeps the raw game port off the public
  interface, so nginx+TLS is the only way in.
