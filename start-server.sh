# Build (if needed) and start the GUNBATTE ROYALE ladder server.
#
# Usage:
#   ./start-server.sh                    # start on port 8321
#   PORT=9000 ./start-server.sh          # custom port
#   ./start-server.sh --house-bots 0     # extra args go to `gunbatte-server serve`
#
# Re-running restarts: the build runs first (a failed build leaves the old
# server up), then any previous instance listening on the port is stopped
# (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 10s), then the new one starts — so a stale
# server no longer makes the new one die with "address already in use".
#
# The VPS runs the server under systemd; use `systemctl restart gunbatte` there
# rather than this script.
#
# Endpoints once up:
#   http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/          viewer (watch replays / PLAY LIVE)
#   http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/ladder    standings + match history
